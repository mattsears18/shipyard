# Worker-preamble fragment — `gh` JSON discipline (field-scoping cookbook)

On-demand fragment of the `shipyard:worker-preamble` skill (see [`SKILL.md`](./SKILL.md)). The one-sentence rule itself — every `gh` call whose output you'll read MUST scope the response to the fields you actually consume — stays in the always-loaded core under `SKILL.md § "`gh` JSON discipline"`. This fragment carries the reference material behind it: which subcommands take the scoping flags, the two-pattern terseness spectrum, the common-projections table, and the default-mode / piping anti-patterns. Load it when you're about to write a `gh` call and want the exact flag shape rather than re-deriving it. Every citation of `worker-preamble § "gh JSON discipline"` is satisfied by the core's rule sentence alone — this fragment is optional reference, not required reading, for those citations.

## `gh` JSON discipline — field-scoping cookbook

The rule applies to **every read-shape `gh` subcommand**:

- `gh issue view / list`, `gh pr view / list`, `gh run list / view` — pass `--json <fields>`. Pick the smallest field set that satisfies the immediate read.
- `gh api <path>` — pass `--jq '<expr>'` to project the response inline. Same effect as piping to `jq`, one less subprocess.
- `gh repo view` — pass `--json <fields> -q <expr>` when reading (e.g. `--json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name`).

Mutation-shape subcommands — `gh issue close`, `gh issue comment`, `gh issue edit`, `gh pr comment`, `gh pr edit`, `gh pr merge`, `gh pr create`, `gh label create` — are exempt: their output is small (usually empty or a single URL on success) and there's no field to scope.

**Two patterns, in increasing terseness:**

```bash
# Good — field-scoped, jq projection done client-side after the call returns.
gh pr view 142 --repo <owner/repo> --json statusCheckRollup,mergeStateStatus
# (your jq runs against the small JSON returned)

# Better — field-scoped AND inline-projected, so the response itself is already the shape you want.
gh pr view 142 --repo <owner/repo> \
  --json statusCheckRollup,mergeStateStatus \
  -q '{mergeable: .mergeStateStatus, checks: [.statusCheckRollup[] | {name, conclusion}]}'
```

Prefer the inline `-q` form when the projection is a stable shape. Drop to the field-scoped-only form when the caller does multiple independent projections on the same response (worth the extra fields to avoid a second `gh` round-trip).

**Common projections worth remembering:**

| Need | Pattern |
|---|---|
| PR's check rollup (pass/fail/pending) | `gh pr view <M> --json statusCheckRollup,mergeStateStatus` |
| PR's head branch (for `git switch`) | `gh pr view <M> --json headRefName -q .headRefName` |
| Default branch | `gh repo view <owner/repo> --json defaultBranchRef -q .defaultBranchRef.name` |
| Issue body + labels + comments (issue-work step 0) | `gh issue view <N> --json state,assignees,labels,body,title,comments,author` |
| List PRs awaiting review with status fields | `gh pr list --json number,title,statusCheckRollup,mergeStateStatus,headRefName,labels` |
| Count something via gh + jq | `... --json number --jq 'length'` (NOT `... --json number | jq 'length'`) |

**Don't go default-mode.** A bare `gh issue list` / `gh pr list` / `gh pr view` (no `--json`) returns the full default projection in human-readable form — fine for an interactive terminal, expensive when piped into agent context. The rule applies even for "I just need to know if it exists" — use `--json number --jq 'length'` (or `--json id -q .id`) and let the response be a single integer / string.

**Don't pipe `gh ... --json` into a separate `jq`** when `--jq` (the gh-internal flag) would do the same projection. The piped form forks a second process and serializes the full JSON across a pipe before jq filters it; `--jq` filters server-side on the gh-CLI side of the boundary, so the agent's stdout block already arrives projected. The token savings are downstream of that — a smaller stdout block carries fewer tokens into the next tool-result. (Two-step pipes are still fine when you need `jq` features `gh --jq` doesn't expose — `--slurp`, multi-input, advanced output formatting.)
