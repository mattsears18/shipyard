# Fix-checks-only mode (PR triage)

Repair failing CI on an existing PR. **No new PR, no scope expansion, no PR title/description edits, no issue close.** Run the fix-loop until checks are green or the 3-attempt cap is hit.

**Shared rules live in `shipyard:worker-preamble`** — load that skill first if you haven't already (see the entry file [`agents/issue-worker.md`](../issue-worker.md)). This file owns only the fix-checks-only specifics.

## Inputs (from the dispatch prompt)

- PR number `#M`.
- Head branch name `<headRefName>` — the orchestrator passes this so you don't have to look it up.
- Target repo `<owner/repo>`.

## Setup

The harness placed you inside an isolated worktree on some placeholder branch (typically `worktree-agent-<id>`). Land on the PR's actual head branch with the **safe two-step** — do NOT use `gh pr checkout` (see worker-preamble's worktree discipline rule 2):

```bash
HEAD_REF=$(gh pr view <M> --repo <owner/repo> --json headRefName -q .headRefName)
git fetch origin "$HEAD_REF"
git switch "$HEAD_REF"
```

**If `git switch` fails with "is already checked out at <path>"** — the head branch is still locked in the originating worker's worktree. The orchestrator's pre-dispatch head-branch reap should already have released a `self-ancestor` (our own session's PID) lock before you started, regardless of dispatch site: from the steady-state `failed_prs` queue it's the [steady-state 2d reap (#368)](../../commands/do-work/steady-state.md#c-dispatch-a-replacement-if-work-remains--mandatory-action), and from drain it's the [drain pre-dispatch reap (#370)](../../commands/do-work/drain.md#pre-dispatch-head-branch-reap-self-pid-lock-release). A surviving collision means the lock is `peer-alive` (a genuinely-live non-orchestrator process), which the orchestrator correctly declined to yank. Bail with `blocked #<M> at fix-checks: head branch <HEAD_REF> locked in another worktree — needs end-of-session reap` rather than working around it with a temporary branch. The next session's startup sweep clears the lock.

## Hard rules

1. Do NOT modify scope. Do NOT amend the PR title/description. Do NOT close the linked issue from this PR. Do NOT add new tests or refactors — fix only what's needed to turn the failing checks green.
2. **Hard cap: 3 fix attempts.** After the 3rd failure, return `blocked #<M> at fix-checks: <last failing check> — <last error excerpt>`. The orchestrator will label the PR `blocked:ci` and move on. Do not let one PR consume the session.
3. **`green #<M>` is a load-bearing claim**, not a hypothesis — see the return contract below.

## Return contract — read carefully

When you finish, your **last line MUST be exactly one of the three strings below** (with `<M>` substituted). Anything else is a contract violation that wastes orchestrator turns. The exact semantics of `green` matter:

- `green #<M>` — **a full CI run completed and passed AFTER your final push.** Not "pushed and queued." Not "the failure looked transient so I optimistically declared victory." Not "I rebased onto a green main so it should work now." The contract is "the rollup is fully `SUCCESS` (or `SKIPPED` / `NEUTRAL`) at the moment you return." You enforce this by running the `gh pr checks <M> --watch --interval 30` step in the fix-loop below to completion — not by polling once and assuming the queued runs will eventually pass. The orchestrator's [step A reconcile](../../commands/do-work/steady-state.md#a-reconcile-the-return) spot-checks `statusCheckRollup` on every `green` return and will downgrade you to `pending` / `failing` if the rollup contradicts your claim. The advisory log will say `[fix-checks-verify] downgraded #<M> green→…` — that's the breadcrumb saying you returned too early.
- `noop: already green #<M>` — no failures by the time you started. Same verification semantics: confirm with a single `gh pr view <M> --json statusCheckRollup` that the rollup is fully passing before returning this. The orchestrator spot-checks this path too.

  **Use the latest-per-name projection, not the raw rollup walk** (issue [#333](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/issues/333)). `statusCheckRollup` returns every check run for the PR's head SHA — including superseded runs. A naïve `.statusCheckRollup[] | select(.conclusion=="FAILURE")` walk false-positives whenever a check ran, failed, was re-triggered, and passed — the first FAILURE entry trips the bail even though the latest run is SUCCESS. De-duplicate by `name` and take the most recent entry per check before walking for failures:

  ```bash
  fails=$(gh pr view <M> --repo <owner/repo> --json statusCheckRollup --jq '
    [.statusCheckRollup
     | group_by(.name)
     | map(sort_by(.completedAt // .startedAt // "") | last)
     | .[]
     | select((.conclusion // .status // "") | test("FAILURE|ERROR|TIMED_OUT|CANCELLED|ACTION_REQUIRED"))]
    | length')
  ```

  If `fails == 0` at the moment of return, you can claim `noop: already green` (or `green`). If `fails > 0` AND you haven't pushed any fix this dispatch, you have real work to do — fall into the fix-loop. The reduction is load-bearing: `group_by(.name) | map(... | last)` collapses N entries per check name to 1 (the latest), so a stale FAILURE superseded by a later SUCCESS is correctly filtered out.

- `blocked #<M> at fix-checks: <reason>` — 3 attempts exhausted or the failure is structural.

**Do NOT return mid-stream status updates.** Strings like the following are contract violations and are NOT acceptable terminal returns:

- `"E2E shards typically take 8-15 min. Let me wait for the Monitor notifications."`
- `"Let me wait for the monitor to report results."`
- `"Routine progress, no action needed. Waiting for unit + E2E results."`
- `"Lint & Typecheck pass. Waiting for unit + E2E."`
- `"Unit tests pass. Awaiting E2E shards."`
- `"Shard 3/3 passes. Awaiting shards 1 and 2 (2 was the previously failing one)."`
- `"Routine progress."` / `"Waiting for X."` / `"Shard N still running."`

Each of those returns is treated by the harness as a **completion notification**, forcing the orchestrator to spend a turn just to acknowledge "stale re-notification, no state change." A single fix-checks dispatch that returns six narrative updates burns six orchestrator turns for what should have been one terminal return. The orchestrator's [step A reconcile](../../commands/do-work/steady-state.md#a-reconcile-the-return) parses your last line by matching the documented prefixes (`green`, `noop:`, `blocked`); a string that doesn't match falls through to a defensive `gh pr view <M>` probe, and the orchestrator logs `[fix-checks-unrecognized]` against your worker.

**If checks are still running when you'd otherwise be ready to return, block your own turn on the watch loop until they finish — then return one of the three values above.** The agent harness's notion of "completion" is "you produced your final assistant message and stopped" — it has no way to distinguish "I'm waiting for monitor notifications" from "I'm done." So the only correct way to wait for CI is to keep the foreground bash call running:

```bash
gh pr checks <M> --repo <owner/repo> --watch --interval 30
```

This command exits zero when the rollup resolves to all green, non-zero on any failure — either way, you re-enter the fix-loop or fall through to the return. Do not produce intermediate assistant messages narrating "shard 2 still running" or "waiting for monitor"; those are visible as completions to the harness and the contract violation kicks in.

## Fix-loop

In this mode — and only this mode — you do block on CI, because resolving a known-failing PR is the agent's entire job.

```bash
gh pr checks <M> --repo <owner/repo> --watch --interval 30
```

On failure:

1. Identify the failing check:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks <M> --repo <owner/repo> --json name,state,link
   ```
2. Pull failed logs:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run-id> --repo <owner/repo> --log-failed
   ```
3. Reproduce locally if practical.
4. Fix the smallest thing that resolves the failure. Don't expand scope.
5. `git commit` + `git push` to the same branch. Never `--no-verify` (see worker-preamble). Never force-push unless rewriting history is genuinely required.
6. Re-watch checks.

**Hard cap: 3 fix attempts.** After the 3rd failure, return `blocked #<M> at fix-checks: <last failing check> — <last error excerpt>`. The orchestrator will label the PR `blocked:ci` and move on.

**Record root-cause context before returning `green`.** When you identify the actual root cause of a failure (especially flake / race / environmental issues that look mysterious from the failing log alone), post a one-line comment on the PR before returning. Format: `Fix-checks: <one-line root cause>` (e.g., "Fix-checks: flaky because of a race in the test setup — serialized the fixture init"). This stops the next session's auditor or human reviewer from re-flagging the same failure mode without context. Routine "applied the obvious fix to the obvious error" cases don't need a comment — the diff is the explanation. Use `gh pr comment <M> --repo <owner/repo> --body "..."`; if it errors, log an advisory and continue — don't block the return on a comment failure. This is the fix-checks-only analog of issue-work mode's step 5.5 decision-context rule.

## Don't

- Don't open a new PR. The PR is already open; this mode repairs CI only.
- Don't modify the PR title or description.
- Don't close the linked issue from this PR. The original PR body already has the `Closes #N` line; merging the rebased branch closes the issue automatically.
- Don't add new tests or refactors. Fix only what's needed to turn the failing checks green.
- Don't keep trying past 3 fix attempts. The cap is a circuit breaker, not a suggestion.
- **Don't return `green #<M>` on the basis of a hypothesis.** "I rebased onto a commit that should fix this" is a hypothesis until CI confirms it. The contract is unambiguous: `green` means the rollup is fully `SUCCESS` (or `SKIPPED` / `NEUTRAL`) at the moment of return. If checks are still queued / running, you have not finished the fix-loop — keep watching, or return `blocked` if the 3-attempt cap is up. The orchestrator's step A reconcile spot-checks every `green` return against `gh pr view <M> --json statusCheckRollup` and will silently downgrade you to `pending` / `failing` if the rollup contradicts the claim. Returning `green` on a `PENDING` rollup wastes a turn and earns you a `[fix-checks-verify] downgraded` advisory in the orchestrator's log.
- **Don't return narrative status updates.** Strings like "waiting for monitor," "shard 2 still running," "routine progress, awaiting E2E," "unit tests pass, awaiting shards" are NOT acceptable terminal returns. The agent harness treats every assistant message ending your turn as a completion notification, so each narrative update forces the orchestrator to spend a turn acknowledging a stale re-notification. The only acceptable terminal returns are the three documented strings: `green #<M>`, `noop: already green #<M>`, `blocked #<M> at fix-checks: <reason>`. If CI is still running and you'd otherwise return, keep the `gh pr checks <M> --watch --interval 30` foreground bash call alive instead — that blocks your own turn until the rollup resolves.
- **Don't return without `TaskStop`'ing any `Monitor` sub-tasks you spawned.** This mode is the canonical spawner of Monitors (watching shard rollups, polling for run completion) and the canonical victim of [#297](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/issues/297)'s notification leak — workers returned `green`/`blocked`/`reaped:` and left their Monitors running, each one re-invoking the orchestrator for a no-op turn for the next 15–60 min. The worker-preamble's "Stop background processes before returning" section is the source of truth — it applies on EVERY termination path (clean returns, bails, reaps). If you only used the foreground `gh pr checks <M> --watch --interval 30` pattern (no `Monitor`, no `run_in_background: true` Bash), there's nothing to stop; the foreground command exits with your push and can't outlive the return.
- Don't `--no-verify` to skip hooks. Fix the underlying issue. (See worker-preamble for the absolute prohibition.)
- Don't disable a failing test to make checks pass. If the test is genuinely broken (not the code), comment on the PR with the evidence and return `blocked #<M> at fix-checks: <reason>`.
- Don't edit `.github/workflows/` or branch protection to make a check pass.
- **Leave your worktree on the PR's head branch when you return** (not `main` / the default branch). See worker-preamble's worktree discipline rule 3.
