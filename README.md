Personal [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) plugins by Matt Sears. The headliner is **`shipyard`** — an autonomous engineering loop that finds work via audits, refines raw user feedback into actionable tickets, and burns down the backlog with a rolling pool of parallel workers in isolated git worktrees.

</p>

*Shipyard at a glance — five stages of the autonomous engineering loop. Read the [How shipyard works](#shipyard) section below for details.*

## Quick start

Get from zero to your first auto-merging PR in about five minutes.

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and signed in.
- The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`). Shipyard drives every GitHub interaction through `gh`.
- A local checkout of a GitHub repo with at least one open issue. Branch protection / required CI checks are fine — shipyard arms auto-merge and lets the merge train do the rest.

### 1. Install the plugin

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add mattsears18/shipyard
claude plugin install shipyard@mattsears-plugins
```

Then restart Claude Code so the new slash commands register.

### 2. Run your first command

From inside any GitHub-connected repo, try one of these:

```sh
# Burn down the backlog — pick up open issues and ship PRs in parallel.
/do-work --concurrency 4

# Find work — audit a live URL for performance, SEO, a11y, and best-practices,
# and autonomously file an issue per finding.
/audit lighthouse https://your-app.example.com

# Refine issues that aren't ready for /do-work yet (source-branched):
# user-feedback classify+rewrite, open-questions resolve-defaults, or
# escalate-to-triage fall-through. /refine-feedback still works as an alias.
/refine-issues

# See what's blocked on YOU (PRs waiting on review, issues needing triage, etc.)
# — the human-facing counterpart to /do-work.
/my-turn
```

### 3. Watch the loop

When you run `/do-work`, you'll see:

- A markdown table of the ranked backlog at start (and again at end of session).
- A one-line status header printed before the initial pool fill (and re-printed whenever repo-health state changes — main going red, a divert firing, the failing-PR count crossing the threshold).
- `--concurrency N` parallel workers, each in its own isolated git worktree under `.claude/worktrees/`, opening PRs that close their assigned issues. Each PR has auto-merge with squash armed — green CI means it merges itself.

When `/audit` runs, you'll see filed issues with severity labels (`P0`/`P1`/`P2`) and an audit-key HTML comment for dedup.

### Next steps

- Read [How it works](#how-it-works) for the full four-phase loop (inputs → refine → human review → orchestrator → workers → PR).
- Skim [What's been hardened](#whats-been-hardened) for the safety properties that keep autonomous runs from clobbering your repo.
- Wire up a Sentry / Datadog / Dependabot integration that files GitHub issues — see [Plays well with everything that files GitHub issues](#plays-well-with-everything-that-files-github-issues).

## Plugins

### `shipyard`

An autonomous engineering loop for web + mobile app development. Three things it does:

1. **Finds work** — `/audit` runs deep audits across UX, performance, security, accessibility, DX, privacy, PWA readiness, release readiness, SEO, tech debt, and testing, and autonomously files GitHub issues for every finding.
2. **Refines work** — `/refine-issues` (formerly `/refine-feedback`) is a source-branched refiner: raw user-feedback issues get classified (already-done / decline / legitimate) and rewritten into implementation-ready tickets; Claude-filed feature requests with `## Open questions` get reasonable defaults committed; everything else falls through to `needs-triage`. The user-feedback path is gated by a `needs-human-review` label so no code-modifying agent runs until a human signs off; the open-questions and triage paths are decoupled from human review.
3. **Does work** — `/do-work` orchestrates a rolling pool of parallel issue-workers, each in an isolated git worktree. It dispatches up to `--concurrency` workers at once, opens PRs with auto-merge, and gracefully handles failing checks, red main CI, and PR pileups via specialized diversion workers.

**Slash commands:**

- `/audit lighthouse <url>` — perf / SEO / best-practices / agentic browsing via Lighthouse
- `/audit web-ux <url>` — live tour via Chrome DevTools MCP
- `/audit mobile-ux` — review of stored screenshots (`store-assets/screenshots/{ios,android}/*`)
- `/audit ux <url>` — web-ux + mobile-ux in parallel
- `/audit security <url>` — deps, secrets in git, Firebase rules, headers, mobile manifests
- `/audit a11y <url>` — Lighthouse a11y category + manual keyboard / screen-reader tour
- `/audit dx` — developer-experience catalog (lints, hooks, observability, contributor docs, etc.)
- `/audit all <url>` — every audit in parallel
- `/refine-issues` — process refinement-gated issues (user-feedback classify+rewrite, open-questions resolve-defaults, or escalate-to-triage fall-through). `/refine-feedback` still works as a back-compat alias.
- `/do-work` — burn down the issue backlog with a rolling pool of parallel workers
- `/my-turn` — surveys open PRs, the issue backlog, and recent comments to produce a prioritized list of items currently blocked on **you** (not on Claude). Read-only — pairs with `/do-work` as the human-driven counterpart.
- `/shipyard:init` — _(coming in [#165](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/issues/165))_ scaffold a `shipyard.config.json` with layered overrides for concurrency, label namespaces, and per-mode caps.

Each audit runs in an isolated subagent, files its own issues using the shared `filing-github-issues` skill (Conventional Commits titles, label discovery, duplicate search), and respects the severity rules in `audit-rubrics` (P0–P2). Fully autonomous — no per-step approval gates.

## How it works

> Full visual infographic in [#37](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/issues/37) (in progress). Until then, here's the conceptual flow.

The loop has four phases, and the orchestrator drives them on every iteration of `/do-work`:

1. **Inputs.** Issues arrive from multiple sources, all unified at the GitHub-issue layer. The `/audit` family files them autonomously — a Lighthouse pass on a live URL, a Chrome DevTools tour, a security sweep, an a11y audit, etc. — each finding becomes a labeled GitHub issue with severity (`P0`/`P1`/`P2`). Your app's feedback form posts raw user reports via a backend proxy that opens issues carrying `user-feedback`. Humans file issues through the [GitHub issue template chooser](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) (`bug_report`, `feature_request`, `user_feedback`). At intake, the [`intake-refinement-gate.yml`](.github/workflows/intake-refinement-gate.yml) workflow conditionally applies `needs-refinement` — external authors, bodies with unresolved `## Open questions`, bare one-liners, and bot-authored issues all get gated for refinement before any worker is dispatched.

2. **Refine.** `/refine-issues` reads each issue carrying the generic `needs-refinement` pipeline gate and branches by source signal: raw user-feedback issues get classified (`already-done` / `decline` / `legitimate`), preserved, and rewritten into engineering tickets with `needs-human-review` set; Claude-filed feature requests with open questions get reasonable defaults committed and become dispatch-eligible immediately; everything else falls through to `needs-triage` for human review. `needs-human-review` is **decoupled** from `needs-refinement` — only the user-feedback branch applies it. No code-modifying agent will touch user-feedback issues until `needs-human-review` is removed.

3. **Human review.** You scan the refined backlog, drop `needs-human-review` from the ones you want shipped, and run `/do-work`. This is the only required human step. Everything before it (audits filing, feedback refining) and everything after (dispatch, fix-up, merge) is autonomous. Use [`/my-turn`](plugins/shipyard/commands/my-turn.md) for a focused read-only view of what's actually blocked on you across PRs and issues.

4. **Orchestrator → workers → PR.** `/do-work` ranks the eligible backlog, then keeps `--concurrency` workers in flight at all times. Each worker is dispatched into an isolated git worktree on a deterministic branch (`do-work/issue-<N>`), implements the smallest change that satisfies the acceptance criteria, opens a PR that closes the issue, and enables auto-merge with squash. Green CI = merged = the next worker slot opens. When CI goes red, an in-progress PR fails its checks, or the default branch breaks, the orchestrator diverts a worker to fix it before resuming normal backlog work.

The result: you write issues (or let `/audit` write them), you sign off on the user-feedback ones, and the rest of the chain runs without you.

### Label conventions

Shipyard treats several label families as load-bearing — origin labels (`user-feedback`, `audit:<dimension>`), the session-stamp label (`shipyard`), state labels in the `blocked:*` namespace (`blocked:agent` / `blocked:ci` — renamed from `blocked` / `ci-blocked` in 1.3.29), and gate labels (`needs-refinement`, `needs-human-review`, `needs-triage`). The canonical reference lives in [`CLAUDE.md`'s "Label conventions" section](./CLAUDE.md#label-conventions) — that's the source of truth; this README intentionally doesn't duplicate it.

### Observability — per-session token cost

Every `/do-work` session writes per-session token-usage data to `~/.shipyard/sessions/<session-id>.json` and posts cost-tracking comments on the issues and PRs it touches, so you can see at a glance how much a given backlog burndown cost. Useful for tuning `--concurrency`, deciding which audits are worth running on a cron, and spotting agents that are spending too many tokens for the work they ship. Landed in [#179](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/pull/179) / shipyard 1.3.30.

## What's been hardened

A non-exhaustive list of safety properties the orchestrator and workers carry today. Each bullet links to the PR or issue where the property landed:

- The orchestrator never goes idle while workable backlog or open `@me` PRs remain — a structured invariant line prints every turn so going-quiet-with-work-left is detectable ([#23](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/issues/23)).
- User feedback enters via a backend-mediated intake and is refined + human-gated before any code-modifying agent runs against it ([#24](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/issues/24)).
- Workers are forbidden from `git commit --no-verify` and equivalent hook bypasses, enforced both at the prompt and at the `Bash` permission layer in `plugin.json` ([#26](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/issues/26)).
- The orchestrator re-checks the backlog before every dispatch — issues filed mid-session don't have to wait for a periodic refresh to be picked up ([#29](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/issues/29)).
- Issue-worker dispatches are pinned to `isolation: "worktree"` via a `PreToolUse` hook. Workers operate in a dedicated worktree and never touch the user's primary checkout's HEAD ([#34](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/issues/34)).

## See it in action

Every PR opened by `/do-work` carries the `shipyard` label (renamed from `do-work` in 1.2.0). The repo's own merged history is the living demo:

[**All `shipyard`-labeled closed PRs →**](https://github.com/mattsears18/shipyard/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+label%3Ashipyard)

Each one was opened, fixed-up through CI failures (if any), and merged without a human touching the keyboard between issue triage and PR review.

## Plays well with everything that files GitHub issues

Shipyard doesn't care **where** an issue came from — it only cares that the issue exists, is open, and isn't already assigned to someone else. That makes it compose with any service that can file GitHub issues:

- **Sentry** → auto-files issues for new production exceptions. Shipyard reproduces the bug, ships a fix, closes the Sentry issue.
- **Datadog / New Relic / Honeycomb** → file issues for SLO breaches and anomalies. Shipyard investigates and fixes the underlying cause.
- **Dependabot / Renovate** → file PRs for outdated/vulnerable dependencies. Shipyard picks up the open issues those tools file and resolves them.
- **GitHub Advanced Security / CodeQL** → file issues for code-scanning findings. Shipyard fixes the vulnerability or files a justified suppression.
- **Customer support tools (Zendesk, Intercom)** → many have GitHub integrations that file issues from support tickets. Shipyard treats those just like user feedback (filed with the `user-feedback` label → refined → human-reviewed → worked; see [Refines work](#shipyard) above and the `/refine-issues` flow — the user-feedback classify+rewrite branch).
- **Your own infrastructure** — anything you wire up via the GitHub API to file issues.

The pattern: every "thing that's broken" becomes a GitHub issue, shipyard works the issue, the fix ships. The app becomes **effectively self-healing** — production errors don't sit until a human notices; they sit until shipyard's next dispatch.

### Concrete example: Sentry round-trip

1. A user hits a `NullPointerException` in your app. Sentry catches it.
2. Sentry's GitHub integration files a new issue: "NullPointerException in `OrderService.calculateDiscount`" with stack trace + frequency + affected user count.
3. Shipyard's `/do-work` is running (locally, in CI on a cron, or invoked manually). On its next backlog refresh, it picks up the new issue.
4. The dispatched worker reproduces the failure (per the mandatory-repro rule), writes a failing test, fixes the null check, commits, opens a PR with `Closes #N`, enables auto-merge.
5. CI runs green. PR auto-merges. Sentry's issue closes automatically (via the `Closes #N` line). The fix is deployed on your next release.

Total human intervention: **zero**, modulo whatever review process you keep at the PR level (branch protection, required reviewers, etc.).

The Sentry flow above is illustrative, not a case study — your mileage depends on the quality of the upstream issue and the kind of bug. See the caveats below.

### Caveats

- **Quality of the upstream issue matters.** A clean Sentry stack trace is great; a one-line "something broke" issue is not. The better the auto-filer's report, the better the fix.
- **User-feedback flows through refinement first.** Customer-support tools that file raw user complaints should label issues with `user-feedback` + `needs-human-review` (the `intake-refinement-gate.yml` workflow handles `needs-refinement` automatically) so `/refine-issues`' classify+rewrite branch cleans them up and a human signs off before shipyard touches them.
- **Not everything is auto-fixable.** Shipyard returns `blocked` on issues it can't repro or for which it can't infer a fix. Those still need humans — but they were going to need humans anyway. The win is on the long tail of "easy fixes that just sat there."
- **Set sane labels at the auto-filer.** Most integrations let you specify labels at the issue-creation API call. Apply a priority label (`P0`/`P1`/`P2`) so the orchestrator ranks them correctly.

## Optional: auto-file issues on skill/agent failure

The `shipyard` plugin can automatically file a GitHub issue against `mattsears18/shipyard` whenever one of its own skills or agents appears to have failed during your session. The point: real failures become structured bug reports without anyone having to type one up.

It is **opt-in** — nothing is filed unless you set:

```sh
export CLAUDE_PLUGINS_AUTOREPORT=1
```

Once enabled, hooks (`PostToolUse` on `Task|Agent` and `SubagentStop`) invoke `plugins/shipyard/scripts/report-plugin-error.sh`. That script:

1. **Detects** failure signals — `is_error: true`, `error:` / `stderr:` fields, or `blocked:` / `Error:` / `Traceback (...)` / `Fatal:` markers in the agent output. Only acts on subagents/skills whose name starts with `shipyard:`.
2. **Scrubs secrets** — GitHub PATs (`ghp_…`), Anthropic / OpenAI keys (`sk-ant-…`, `sk-…`), AWS access keys, `Authorization:` / `Bearer …` headers, email addresses, `$HOME` paths, and any 40+ char hex blob.
3. **Builds a signature** from the skill/agent name + a digit-normalized error excerpt, then **searches open `auto-reported` issues** for a match. If found → adds a comment with the new occurrence. If not → files a fresh issue with `auto-reported` and `bug` labels.
4. **Never breaks your session** — the helper traps errors and always exits 0. The hook runs the helper detached in the background so reports don't block the foreground.

### What is transmitted

Scrubbing covers **secret-shaped patterns** (the list in step 2 above) — it does not redact general prose. Each auto-report includes the following fields drawn from the live session, and any non-secret content in them is filed as-is:

- **Invocation prompt** — the agent's task description, up to 1000 chars. For a `shipyard:issue-worker` dispatch this is the full task string (e.g. `work issue 42 in <owner>/<repo>`), which may include the target repo name and issue identifiers.
- **Error details** — up to ~2000 chars of the failure output.
- **Transcript excerpt** — the last 80 lines (up to 3000 chars) of the agent's session transcript. This is the raw record of the session and can include filenames, file contents read via the `Read` tool, `gh issue view` output, git diff output, and bash command output from the working session.
- **Environment** — OS, shell, Claude Code version, model.

If the failing session was operating on a **private codebase or private issue tracker**, those excerpts may carry filenames, code snippets, or issue text from that codebase into a public GitHub issue on the target auto-report repo. The scrubber has no way to distinguish "private project context" from "debug noise" — only secret-shaped tokens are removed.

**Preview before opting in.** Use the dry-run mode (`CLAUDE_PLUGINS_AUTOREPORT_DRY=1`, documented below) to see exactly what *would* be filed without actually filing it. If you work with sensitive codebases, either preview reports this way before enabling live mode, or set `CLAUDE_PLUGINS_AUTOREPORT_REPO` to a private repo you control so the reports never become public.

### Configuration

| Env var | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAUDE_PLUGINS_AUTOREPORT` | unset | Must be `1` to enable. |
| `CLAUDE_PLUGINS_AUTOREPORT_REPO` | `mattsears18/shipyard` | Target repo for auto-reports. |
| `CLAUDE_PLUGINS_AUTOREPORT_DRY` | unset | When `1`, the helper prints the would-be issue as JSON to stdout instead of calling `gh`. Used by the test suite and useful for local previews. |

### Issue shape

Every auto-report has these sections:

- `## What happened` — short failure summary.
- `## Skill/Agent` — name, hook event, tool.
- `## Reproduction` — invoking prompt + description (scrubbed).
- `## Error details` — first ~2000 chars of the failure output (scrubbed).
- `## Environment` — OS, shell, Claude Code version, model.
- `## Transcript excerpt` — last 80 lines of the agent transcript, scrubbed.
- `## Recommendations for improvement` — pattern-level suggestions for maintainers.
- An HTML-comment de-dup signature: `<!-- autoreport-key=<skill>::<normalized-error> -->`.

### Try it out (dry run)

```sh
echo '{"tool_name":"Agent","tool_input":{"subagent_type":"shipyard:issue-worker","prompt":"work issue 1"},"tool_response":{"is_error":true,"error":"Error: gh api 404"}}' \
  | CLAUDE_PLUGINS_AUTOREPORT=1 CLAUDE_PLUGINS_AUTOREPORT_DRY=1 \
    bash plugins/shipyard/scripts/report-plugin-error.sh
```

You'll get a JSON blob with the `title`, `body`, `labels`, `signature`, and `who` that *would* have been filed.

### Test suite

```sh
bash plugins/shipyard/scripts/tests/report-plugin-error.test.sh
```

### Follow-ups

- v1 ships with `auto-reported` and `bug` labels only. Per-skill / per-agent labels (e.g. `skill:filing-github-issues`, `agent:issue-worker`) are deferred to keep label cardinality controlled until we see what categories actually show up in practice.

## Filing issues

The repo's [issue template chooser](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) routes filers into one of three forms:

- **`bug_report`** — something is broken; includes repro steps + expected vs actual behavior.
- **`feature_request`** — propose new functionality; surfaces an `## Open questions` block that the [`/refine-issues`](plugins/shipyard/commands/refine-issues.md) `resolve-defaults` branch acts on.
- **`user_feedback`** — raw, unstructured user reports; auto-labeled `user-feedback` and routed through the classify+rewrite refiner branch with `needs-human-review` gating.

The `intake-refinement-gate.yml` workflow applies `needs-refinement` conditionally at intake (see [How it works](#how-it-works) above). Anyone opening a PR will see [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) — fill it out so the reviewer has the context they need.
